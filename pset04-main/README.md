# Problem Set 04: Predicates, Quantifiers, and Nested Quantifiers

# CS/MATH 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2024
***

Each Problem Set (PSet) contains problems on recently covered material for you to practice. These prepare you for upcoming assessments and later topics.

# Purpose

This PSet provides practice in predicates and quantifiers, including nested quantifiers, i.e. Sections 1.4 and 1.5.

# Background and requirement

To attempt and submit this PSet you will need
- to know the universal and existential quantifiers
- to be able to define domains for the variables of a quantifier
- to be able to express natural language and mathematical statements in logical syntax and vice versa
- to apply a quantified statement over a given domain
- to evaluate the truth value of a quantified statement
- to express the negation of a quantified statement
- to find counterexamples to universally quantified statements
- to apply methods to determine the equivalence of two quantified statements involving predicates and connectives
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX
